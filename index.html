            <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
            <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at <span class="institution">Polytechnique Montréal</span>, within the Canada Research Chair in Management and Economics of Innovation. My research interests include innovation economics, industrial organization, applied microeconomics, agricultural economics, as well as productivity and economic growth. I am also interested in the application of artificial intelligence methods, particularly machine learning and natural language processing, to address economic and financial issues.</p>
            
            <p>I obtained my Ph.D. in economics from <span class="institution">Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar</span> in 2022. Prior to that, I worked as a consultant for the <span class="institution">International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)</span>. I was also a research fellow at the <span class="institution">African Economic Research Consortium (AERC)</span>. I completed a research internship at <span class="institution">Institut Agro Rennes-Angers</span> (France) and was a visiting researcher at the <span class="institution">University of Ottawa</span> as a Queen Elizabeth Scholar with the Open African Innovation Research program.</p>

            <p>For more details, please refer to my CV.</p>
