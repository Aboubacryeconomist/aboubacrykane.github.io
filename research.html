        <h2>Research Statement</h2>
        <p>My research focuses on applied microeconomics and industrial organization, with a particular emphasis on innovation, productivity, and agricultural economics. My multidisciplinary approach integrates econometrics, management, and modeling to explore how innovation and technology can serve as levers for economic growth and the well-being of economic agents, particularly in contexts where resources and infrastructure are limited.</p>

        <h3>Key Contributions:</h3>
        <p><strong>Doctoral Thesis:</strong> "Innovation Capacity and Its Effect on the Productivity of Senegalese Manufacturing Firms"</p>
        <p>In my doctoral thesis, I analyzed the influence of innovation on the productivity of Senegalese manufacturing firms using an extension of the Crépon-Duguet-Mairesse (CDM, 1998) structural model. My findings revealed an interdependence between technological and non-technological innovations, as well as the significant impact of Research and Development (R&D) activities on process innovation. However, the effect of innovation on productivity remains limited, highlighting the need for an integrated approach that combines innovation, managerial capacities, and a national innovation system. This research not only enriched the literature on industrial organization in Africa but also provided concrete recommendations for improving industrial policy in Senegal. Most of these recommendations have been incorporated into Senegal's industrialization strategy for 2035. I specifically emphasized the importance for Senegal's manufacturing industry to leverage the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) by undergoing a digital transformation. This transformation involves intelligent automation and the integration of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), into the production chain.</p>

        <p><strong>Kane, Aboubacry (2023).</strong> "Analysing the Relationship between Innovation and Productivity: A Case Study of Senegalese Manufacturing Industries." African Economic Research Consortium, Research Paper 542.</p>
        <p>This research article, which serves as a preliminary draft of my thesis, aims to profile innovative companies and examine the link between innovation and productivity in Senegalese manufacturing firms, considering the interaction between different types of innovation. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate regression, the study found that, despite Senegal's satisfactory level of technology adoption, an innovation deficit persists in the industrial sector, particularly in R&D activities. Large enterprises and firms that export their products are the most innovative. However, no significant relationship was found between the gender of the firm’s manager and the adoption of various types of innovation. The study shows that innovation adoption is positively related to improved labor productivity, although this relationship is not observed for other types of innovation.</p>
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This article, funded by the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), was presented at conferences and biannual sessions organized by the AERC. I highlighted the necessity of complementarity between investments in innovation, the development of managerial and technological capacities, and the implementation of coherent innovation policies by the government. The findings of this study have provided a basis for advocating the creation of government programs to support innovation, notably by funding R&D and facilitating access to advanced technologies for Senegalese companies. This research has raised awareness among policymakers about the major obstacles hindering the effective adoption of technologies in Senegalese industries, such as the lack of employee training and the absence of a national innovation system (NIS). By filling a gap in the literature on innovation in Africa, this study has also laid the groundwork for future research.</p>
